# EmployeeList

## What did I focus on?
I focused on the adhering to the architecture and the requirements for the app. I also made sure to leave room to build out the features.

## What code I copied?
I did copy one piece of code, the comparator object, and I made edits to it to fit my class. I did look for solutions to error using google.

## Focus on phone or tablet?
I focused on phone and tablet horizontal view only

I spent 6 hours on the project almost exactly. No lie, I have been practicing and I use a industry standard collection of tools.
